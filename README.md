# Unexpected Behavior with Nested `calc()` in CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error that can arise when using the CSS `calc()` function, specifically when combining percentages with fixed units, and especially in nested `calc()` expressions.  The issue is that the result of the calculation can sometimes become negative, leading to unexpected and inconsistent layout behavior.

## Problem Description

The `calc()` function, while powerful, can be tricky when mixing units.  For example, `calc(50% + 10px)` might return a negative value if the parent container is very narrow. Nested `calc()` functions amplify this problem, making it more difficult to predict and debug. 

## Solution

The solution is to use media queries or JavaScript to detect and adjust element width to avoid negative results.  For simple cases, adding a `min-width` is enough. For more complex scenarios, a more nuanced approach is needed. Consider using JavaScript to calculate the width dynamically or adjusting the calculation based on container size.
